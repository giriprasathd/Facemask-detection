# Facemask-detection
This project is to detect the person is wear facemask or not wearing facemask in  public places like railway station ,airport ,market . Here I have used some dataset which I was have taken from the Kaggle website  and I  have trained the model to detect the person is wear facemask or not wearing the facemask. Dataset contain both with mask and without mask images. . I only develop the model for mask detection, I dont have any face detector model. In order to do face detection .I have downloaded couple of file which is used in face detection. The idea here is with the help of face detector file we will detect the face and with the help of deep learning model (mask_detector.model) we are going to detect the mask. And for camera operation we use open-CV.
